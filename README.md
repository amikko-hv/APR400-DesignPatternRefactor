# APR400-DesignPatternRefactor

Starter code to practice implementing design patterns.

## Task

Refactor the code to introduce *at least one* design pattern from the list below. 

Think about why the design pattern is a good fit.

## Refactoring Ideas

- **Strategy**: Support multiple notification methods (Email, SMS, Push) using a strategy interface.
- **Factory Method**: Use a factory to create different types of notifiers.
- **Singleton**: Make the Notifier a singleton if global access is needed.
- **Decorator**: Add logging or formatting as decorators around the notification.
- **Observer**: Allow users to subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications.
- **Adapter**: Integrate with a legacy notification system.
